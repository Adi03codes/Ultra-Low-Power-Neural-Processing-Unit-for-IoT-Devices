# Ultra-Low-Power-Neural-Processing-Unit-for-IoT-Devices
EdgeNPU-IoT is an ultra-low-power neural processing unit (NPU) framework designed for running deep learning models directly on IoT and embedded devices. The project focuses on hardware-efficient VLSI architectures, memory-optimized dataflows, and near-sensor AI to enable real-time inference under milliwatt-level power budgets.
